Description: The Zend OPcache provides faster PHP execution through opcode caching and
 optimization. It improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script
 bytecode in the shared memory. This eliminates the stages of reading code from
 the disk and compiling it on future access. In addition, it applies a few
 bytecode optimization patterns that make code execution faster.
